The purpose of the Underrepresented Minorities in Computing club (URMC), is to promote diversity in the tech space. [Our website](https://urmc.cs.cornell.edu) serves to contribute to URMC's outreach, and inform our community of who we are and what resources we offer at Cornell.

## Development
### 1. Installation

To run the website you must install [React](https://react.dev/learn/installation). You need to also install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for building and running our website locally. Node Package Manager (npm) comes installed with Node.js, so you don't need to worry about installing npm seperately although it is required.

After you clone the repo into your directory, run `npm install` to install any packages the website may need. Anytime you want to run the website afterwards, run `npm start`.

### 2. Styling
For any questions regarding code cleanliness or styling, refer to the [URMC WebDev Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImqZqqJGLdxjY_TIxWs0IBbJVYc_5c_U1gz1Jrp457E/edit?usp=sharing) where we list what styling guidelines we expect for the website.

### 3. Deployment
To deploy the website, you will need to run `npm run build` to generate the `index.html` and `build` folder containing all the CSS and Javascript code necessary to render the website, both of which can be found in the root `urmc-website` folder.

For any questions on our website, reach out to WebDev chairs Elvis Marcelo (em662@cornell.edu) or Ronald Jabouin (rj336@cornell.edu).
