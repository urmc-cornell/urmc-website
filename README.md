The purpose of the Underrepresented Minorities in Computing club (URMC), is to promote diversity in the tech space. [Our website](https://urmc.cs.cornell.edu) serves to contribute to URMC's outreach, and inform our community of who we are and what resources we offer at Cornell.

## Development
### 1. Installation

We built this website using [React](https://react.dev/learn/installation). We also use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for building and running our website locally. Because npm is installed with Node.js, you don't need to worry about installing npm seperately.

After you clone the repo into your directory, run `npm install` to install any packages the website may need. Anytime you want to run the website afterwards, run `npm start`.

### 2. Styling
For any questions regarding code cleanliness or styling, refer to the [URMC WebDev Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImqZqqJGLdxjY_TIxWs0IBbJVYc_5c_U1gz1Jrp457E/edit?usp=sharing) where we list what styling guidelines we expect for the website.

For any inquiries into our website, reach out to WebDev chairs Elvis Marcelo (em662@cornell.edu) or Ronald Jabouin (rj336@cornell.edu).
